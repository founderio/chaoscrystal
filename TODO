Feature

* Aspects for Items (not only blocks)
* Aspects for Enchantments
* Filter for extraction/expulsion targets (Block, EntityItemStack & Similar, EntityLiving, maybe other?)
* Item Enchanter/Unenchanter

Improvement

* Aspect definitions in some kind of config-file
* Check for Blocks that need to be uncovered (grass, mycelium, ...)
* Meta handling (degrade from all meta types, inverse degrade only to specific ones)
* smooth animation for filter selection hud
* crafting recipes for aspects where possible

Bug

* lighting missing for block renders in hud
* tileentity model rotation based off fps
