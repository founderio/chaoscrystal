(*) == idea, no decision yet

Feature

* Aspects for Items (not only blocks)
* Aspects for Enchantments
* Filter for extraction/expulsion targets (Block, EntityItemStack & Similar, EntityLiving, maybe other?)
* Item Enchanter/Unenchanter
* with glasses on, show aspects as tooltip
* crystalline energy: since it can control the red crystal, let it slow down the crystal
	* too many blue crystals in the area stop a crystal fully
	* blue crystals can only be destroyed by the crystal when an external event happens (explosion, e.g.)
* learn blocks/items before allowing to craft/inverse-degrade them
	* knowledge bound to blocks/crystals, not player, transferred over foci-network, retained in item
	* learning actually needs to destroy item
* crystal weapon (bow? pistol?) that uses aspects/crystals to shoot
	* sentry gun
(*) crystal speed lower/higher depending on amount of aspects inside
* crystal armor that protects from crystal effects
	* low blast resistance, high melee resistance? possible?
(*) destroy items in players inventory unless he wears crystal armor
	* balancing: warn the player before simply starting? idle ticker for players?
	* definitely: do that for what zombies & others carry
(*) move crystals by holding right click/using leash

Improvement

* Aspect definitions in some kind of config-file
* Check for Blocks that need to be uncovered (grass, mycelium, ...)
* Meta handling (degrade from all meta types, inverse degrade only to specific ones)
* smooth animation for filter selection hud
* base aspects on crafting recipes where possible
* effect for transfer foci: lightning
(*) pull objects towards crystal before destroying it (EntityFallingSand!!)
	* effect for chaos crystals: swirling particles
	* particles/lightning/something repeatedly hitting object until destruction
	* let object fall when no further processing is possible
* show all aspects of subsequent degradations in hud
* wait for effects to complete before commencing action
* ignore list for items (flowing water, flowing lava, ...)

Bug

* lighting missing for block renders in hud
* tileentity model rotation based off fps
