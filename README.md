Chaos Crystal, submission for ModJam 2013

Compile Instructions:
* You need to have an Eclipse Project on the classpath that is set up with all required libraries for Forge and Minecraft, such as the one provided by the Forge installer.
* The run configurations don't need to have special settings, just add this code to the classpath and you are good to go.
If you are unsure how to do that, just watch Pahimar's Let's Mod Series.
