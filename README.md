Chaos Crystal, submission for ModJam 3, 2013

Compile Instructions:
* The contained build.gradle script contains everything required to compile a running version of this mod. Just use 'gradlew.bat build' or 'gradlew build'.
* To create the .classpath for the eclipse project this mod represents run 'gradlew.bat eclipse' or 'gradlew eclipse'. Then this project folder can be imported into any eclipse workspace.

Play instructions:
* Grab a pair of crystal glasses, put them on and read the manual!
* On items that have changeable properties you can use shift+scroll wheel. This includes the manual and various foci.
* NEI or creative mode are suggested, as the manual currently can't really display crafting recipes without too much code bloat.
